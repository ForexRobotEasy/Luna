# Luna Forex Expert Advisor

Luna Forex is an expert advisor (EA) designed to automate trading operations in the Forex market. This EA aims to identify high-impact news events and sudden price reversals to execute a mean-reverse trading strategy.

## How it Works

The Luna Forex EA consists of several functions that are executed at different stages of the trading process. Here is a breakdown of each function and its purpose:

### 1. OnInit()

This function is called when the EA is initialized. It is responsible for setting up the necessary configurations and performing any required initialization tasks. In this code, it simply prints a success message indicating that Luna Forex has been initialized successfully.

### 2. OnTick()

This function is called on every tick of the market. It checks if there is a high-impact news event using the `IsNewsEvent()` function. If a high-impact news event is detected, it prints a message indicating that no trading is allowed during such events. Otherwise, it checks for sudden price reversals using the `IsMeanReverse()` function. If a sudden price reversal is detected, it executes the mean-reverse trading strategy by calling the `ExecuteMeanReverseStrategy()` function.

### 3. IsNewsEvent()

This function is responsible for checking if it's a high-impact news event. It should contain code to determine the occurrence of high-impact news events and return `true` if it's a high-impact event or `false` otherwise. This code snippet does not provide the implementation for this function, and it should be customized according to the specific requirements of the trading strategy.

### 4. IsMeanReverse()

This function checks for sudden price reversals in the market. Similar to the `IsNewsEvent()` function, it should contain code to analyze market conditions and determine if a sudden price reversal has occurred. It returns `true` if a reversal is detected or `false` otherwise. The implementation of this function is not provided in the code snippet and should be customized based on the desired trading strategy.

### 5. ExecuteMeanReverseStrategy()

This function is responsible for executing the mean-reverse trading strategy for Luna Forex. It should contain code to place trades, set stop loss and take profit levels, and perform any other necessary trading operations. The implementation of this function is not provided in the code snippet and should be customized based on the specific trading strategy.

### 6. OnDeinit(const int reason)

This function is called when the EA is deinitialized. It performs any necessary cleanup or deinitialization tasks. In this code, it simply prints a message indicating that Luna Forex has been deinitialized, along with the reason for deinitialization.
